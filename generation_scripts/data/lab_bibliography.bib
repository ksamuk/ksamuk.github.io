              genetic methods that infer recombination rates from patterns of
              linkage disequilibrium (LD) in the genome have become a popular
              method to estimate rates of recombination. However, these
              LD-based methods make a variety of simplifying assumptions about
              the populations of interest that are often not met in natural
              populations. One such assumption is the absence of gene flow from
              other populations. Here, we use forward-time population genetic
              simulations of isolation-with-migration scenarios to explore how
              gene flow affects the accuracy of LD-based estimators of
              recombination rate. We find that moderate levels of gene flow can
              result in either the overestimation or underestimation of
              recombination rates by up to 20-50\% depending on the timing of
              divergence. We also find that these biases can affect the
              detection of interpopulation differences in recombination rate,
              causing both false positive and false negatives depending on the
              scenario. We discuss future possibilities for mitigating these
              biases and recommend that investigators exercise caution and
              confirm that their study populations meet assumptions before
              deploying these methods. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The

              long-running and recently renewed debate, but little work has
              sought to understand the selective dynamics underlying the
              evolution of cognitive abilities. Here, we investigate recent
              selection related to cognition in the paper wasp Polistes
              fuscatus-a wasp that has uniquely evolved visual individual
              recognition abilities. We generate high quality de novo genome
              assemblies and population genomic resources for multiple species
              of paper wasps and use a population genomic framework to
              interrogate the probable mode and tempo of cognitive evolution.
              Recent, strong, hard selective sweeps in P. fuscatus contain loci
              annotated with functions in long-term memory formation, mushroom
              body development, and visual processing, traits which have
              recently evolved in association with individual recognition. The
              homologous pathways are not under selection in closely related
              wasps that lack individual recognition. Indeed, the prevalence of
              candidate cognition loci within the strongest selective sweeps
              suggests that the evolution of cognitive abilities has been among
              the strongest selection pressures in P. fuscatus' recent

              selection that shape brain size variation remain obscure. Recent
              studies suggest that predators may select for larger brains
              because increased cognitive and sensory abilities allow prey to
              better elude predators. Yet, there is little direct evidence that
              exposure to predators causes the evolution of larger brains in
              prey species. We experimentally tested this prediction by
              exposing families of 1000-2000 F2 hybrid benthic-limnetic
              threespine stickleback to predators under naturalistic

  abstract = "Population genetic analyses often use summary statistics to
              describe patterns of genetic variation and provide insight into
              evolutionary processes. Among the most fundamental of these
              summary statistics are $\pi$ and dXY , which are used to describe
              genetic diversity within and between populations, respectively.
              Here, we address a widespread issue in $\pi$ and dXY calculation:
              systematic bias generated by missing data of various types. Many
              popular methods for calculating $\pi$ and dXY operate on data
              encoded in the variant call format (VCF), which condenses genetic
              data by omitting invariant sites. When calculating $\pi$ and dXY
              using a VCF, it is often implicitly assumed that missing
              genotypes (including those at sites not represented in the VCF)
              are homozygous for the reference allele. Here, we show how this
              assumption can result in substantial downward bias in estimates
              of $\pi$ and dXY that is directly proportional to the amount of
              missing data. We discuss the pervasive nature and importance of
              this problem in population genetics, and introduce a
              user-friendly UNIX command line utility, pixy, that solves this
              problem via an algorithm that generates unbiased estimates of
              $\pi$ and dXY in the face of missing data. We compare pixy to
              existing methods using both simulated and empirical data, and
              show that pixy alone produces unbiased estimates of $\pi$ and dXY
              regardless of the form or amount of missing data. In summary, our

              algorithm performs as well as previous ad hoc methods while being
              systematic, repeatable, and applicable to mapping chromosomal
              rearrangements in any group of species. In addition, we present a
              systematic survey of chromosomal rearrangements in the annual
              sunflowers, which is a group known for extreme karyotypic
              diversity. We build high-density genetic maps for two subspecies
              of the prairie sunflower, Helianthus petiolaris ssp. petiolaris

              extant karyotype is distinguished by between one and three
              translocations involving only 8 of the 17 chromosomes. This
              nonrandom exchange suggests that specific chromosomes are prone
              to translocation and may thus contribute disproportionately to
              widespread hybrid sterility in sunflowers. These data deepen our
              understanding of chromosome evolution and confirm that Helianthus

              recombination rate (rate of meiotic crossing over) in two natural
              populations of Drosophila pseudoobscura from Utah and Arizona,
              USA. We used an amplicon sequencing approach to obtain
              high-quality genotypes in approximately 8,000 individual
              backcrossed offspring (17 mapping populations with roughly 530
              individuals each), for which we then quantified crossovers.
              Interestingly, variation in recombination rate within and between
              populations largely manifested as differences in genome-wide
              recombination rate rather than remodeling of the local
              recombination landscape. Comparing populations, we discovered
              individuals from the Utah population displayed on average 8\%
              higher crossover rates than the Arizona population, a
              statistically significant difference. Using a QST-FST analysis,

              reproductive barriers, as demonstrated in cases of `reverse

              adaptive introgression between species adapting to a shared,
              moving climatic optimum can readily weaken any reproductive
              barrier, including those that are completely independent of

              isolation (intrinsic and/or non-climatic extrinsic) can lead to

              leading hypothesis is that this similarity in divergence is
              driven by parallel natural selection. However, several recent
              studies have suggested that these patterns may instead be a
              product of the depletion of genetic variation that occurs as
              result of background selection (i.e., linked negative selection).
              To date, there have been few direct tests of these competing
              hypotheses. To determine the relative contributions of background
              selection and parallel selection to patterns of repeated
              differentiation, we examined 24 independently derived populations
              of freshwater stickleback occupying a variety of niches and
              estimated genomic patterns of differentiation in each relative to
              their common marine ancestor. Patterns of genetic differentiation
              were strongly correlated across pairs of freshwater populations
              adapting to the same ecological niche, supporting a role for
              parallel natural selection. In contrast to other recent work, our
              study comparing populations adapting to the same niche produced
              no evidence signifying that similar patterns of genomic
              differentiation are generated by background selection. We also
              found that overall patterns of genetic differentiation were
              considerably more similar for populations found in closer
              geographic proximity. In fact, the effect of geography on the
              repeatability of differentiation was greater than that of
              parallel selection. Our results suggest that shared selective
              landscapes and ancestral variation are the key drivers of

  abstract = "Uncovering factors that shape variation in brain morphology
              remains a major challenge in evolutionary biology. Recently, it
              has been shown that brain size is positively associated with
              level of parental care behavior in various taxa. One explanation
              for this pattern is that the cognitive demands of performing
              complex parental care may require increased brain size. This idea
              is known as the parental brain hypothesis (PBH). We set out to
              test the predictions of this hypothesis in wild populations of
              threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). These fish are
              commonly known to exhibit (1) uniparental male care and (2)
              sexual dimorphism in brain size (males>females). To test the PBH,
              we took advantage of the existence of closely related populations
              of stickleback that display variation in parental care behavior:
              common marine threespine sticklebacks (uniparental male care) and
              white threespine sticklebacks (no care). To begin, we quantified
              genetic differentiation among two common populations and three
              white populations from Nova Scotia. We found overall low
              differentiation among populations, although F ST was increased in
              between-type comparisons. We then measured the brain weights of
              males and females from all five populations along with two
              additional common populations from British Columbia. We found
              that sexual dimorphism in brain size is reversed in white
              stickleback populations: males have smaller brains than females.
              Thus, while several alternatives need to be ruled out, the PBH
              appears to be a reasonable explanation for sexual dimorphism in
              brain size in threespine sticklebacks.",

               Behavioural and armour divergence between these species has been
               predicted to be the result of divergent selection driven in part
               by differential predation from cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus
               clarki). To experimentally test this prediction, we reared split
               families of benthic--limnetic hybrids in the presence or absence
               of trout predation. Our results show that the presence of trout
               had little effect upon stickleback behaviour. We then compared
               performance in behavioural assays among stickleback that varied
               in armour to test if armour morphology correlates with
               behaviour. Our measurements revealed trait correlations between
               several behaviours and components of armour morphology. Trout
               predation did not result in an increased correlation between
               traits, therefore differential trout predation between benthics
               and limnetics is unlikely to be the cause of these correlations.
               The presence of trait correlations in advanced generation
               hybrids suggests that pleiotropy or linkage between genes
               underlying behaviour and armour morphology may be greater than

  abstract = "How does adaptation manage to occur in the face of overwhelming
              gene flow? One popular idea is that the suppression of
              recombination, for example the fixation of a chromosomal
              inversion, can maintain linkage disequilibrium between groups of
              locally adapted alleles that would otherwise be degraded by gene
              flow. This idea has captured the imagination of many geneticists
              and evolutionary biologists, but we still have only a basic
              understanding of its general importance. In this issue of
              Molecular Ecology, Kirubakaran et al. () examine the role of
              recombination suppression in a particularly fascinating example
              of adaptation in the face of gene flow: the evolution of
              migratory differences between interbreeding populations of cod.
              Along the north coast of Norway, two types of cod breed in the
              near-shore waters: a 'stationary' form that lives near the coast
              year round, and a 'migratory' form that lives far offshore and
              only returns to the coast to breed. Using a combination of
              approaches, Kirubakaran et al. () deftly demonstrate that the
              migratory form has completely fixed two adjacent inversions
              containing a suite of genes closely connected to migratory
              behaviour and feeding differences. This work provides an
              excellent example of how recombination suppression can facilitate
              adaptive divergence, and helps us understand the geographic and
              temporal scales over which genomic structural variation evolves.",

               examined a potential example of this phenomenon: an association
               between reduced levels of maternal care behavior and sociality
               in cobweb spiders. We compared 6 different measures of maternal
               care behavior between species from 2 independently derived
               social clades and subsocial species from sister clades. In
               natural nests, we measured the mean distance between egg sacs
               and the nearest female and the proportion of egg sacs being
               attended. In the lab, we measured a female's willingness to
               accept an egg sac, abandon her egg sac when disturbed, repair a
               damaged egg sac, and the speed at which a female reclaimed her
               egg sac when separated from it. Social species from both social

               sociality in alloparenting social spiders",
  author    = "Samuk, Kieran and Avil{\'e}s, Leticia",
  abstract  = "Alloparental care---the care of other's offspring---is a key
               aspect of sociality in many groups of animals. Understanding how
               this complex behavior arises requires identifying both the
               selective forces that may favor it, as well as characteristics
               of particular lineages that facilitate or hinder its evolution.
               One potential hindrance is the existence of discrimination
               against foreign offspring, an obstacle that would need to be
               overcome in order for alloparental care to evolve. In this
               study, we explored whether offspring discrimination may have
               constrained the evolution of alloparental care in social spiders
               in the genus Anelosimus. Social spiders are known for their
               cooperative behaviors, which include alloparental care. After
               quantitatively assessing the extent of alloparenting in the care
               of egg sacs in natural nests of these spiders, we investigated
               whether discrimination against foreign egg sacs existed in
               ancestral pre-social species in the genus. We did so by testing
               for discrimination between a female's own and foreign egg sacs
               in three subsocial sister taxa of each social species
               investigated. We found no detectable evidence of discrimination
               in the care of egg sacs by female Anelosimus, regardless of
               level of sociality. We used these data, along with those from
               previous studies, to infer that a lack of discrimination is
               likely the ancestral state in the genus Anelosimus. This
               supports the idea that offspring discrimination was not a
               constraint on the evolution of alloparental care in social
               Anelosimus species. We discuss the evolutionary implications of
               this finding, and suggest that lack of offspring discrimination
               may have eased the transition from solitary to cooperative
               breeding.",
