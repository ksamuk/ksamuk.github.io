Using a comparative approach, we examined a potential example of this phenomenon: an association between reduced levels of maternal care behavior and sociality in cobweb spiders. We compared 6 different measures of maternal care behavior between species from 2 independently derived social clades and subsocial species from sister clades. In natural nests, we measured the mean distance between egg sacs and the nearest female and the proportion of egg sacs being attended. In the lab, we measured a female’s willingness to accept an egg sac, abandon her egg sac when disturbed, repair a damaged egg sac, and the speed at which a female reclaimed her egg sac when separated from it. Social species from both social clades scored significantly lower than subsocial species from sister clades on 6 and 4 of 6 of these assays of maternal care, respectively. We discuss alternative explanations of this pattern, including the potential role of relaxed natural selection in a social environment in permitting the evolution of a novel “low-parenting” phenotype.",,,,,

One popular idea is that the suppression of recombination, for example the fixation of a chromosomal inversion, can maintain linkage disequilibrium between groups of locally adapted alleles that would otherwise be degraded by gene flow. This idea has captured the imagination of many geneticists and evolutionary biologists, but we still have only a basic understanding of its general importance. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Kirubakaran et al. () examine the role of recombination suppression in a particularly fascinating example of adaptation in the face of gene flow: the evolution of migratory differences between interbreeding populations of cod. Along the north coast of Norway, two types of cod breed in the near-shore waters: a 'stationary' form that lives near the coast year round, and a 'migratory' form that lives far offshore and only returns to the coast to breed. Using a combination of approaches, Kirubakaran et al. () deftly demonstrate that the migratory form has completely fixed two adjacent inversions containing a suite of genes closely connected to migratory behaviour and feeding differences. This work provides an excellent example of how recombination suppression can facilitate adaptive divergence, and helps us understand the geographic and temporal scales over which genomic structural variation evolves.",adaptation; fish; genomics/proteomics; hybridization,"Department of Zoology, University of British Columbia, 6270 University Boulevard, Vancouver, British Columbia, V6T1Z4, Canada.",en,Research Article,

Recently, it has been shown that brain size is positively associated with level of parental care behavior in various taxa. One explanation for this pattern is that the cognitive demands of performing complex parental care may require increased brain size. This idea is known as the parental brain hypothesis (PBH). We set out to test the predictions of this hypothesis in wild populations of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). These fish are commonly known to exhibit (1) uniparental male care and (2) sexual dimorphism in brain size (males>females). To test the PBH, we took advantage of the existence of closely related populations of stickleback that display variation in parental care behavior: common marine threespine sticklebacks (uniparental male care) and white threespine sticklebacks (no care). To begin, we quantified genetic differentiation among two common populations and three white populations from Nova Scotia. We found overall low differentiation among populations, although F ST was increased in between-type comparisons. We then measured the brain weights of males and females from all five populations along with two additional common populations from British Columbia. We found that sexual dimorphism in brain size is reversed in white stickleback populations: males have smaller brains than females. Thus, while several alternatives need to be ruled out, the PBH appears to be a reasonable explanation for sexual dimorphism in brain size in threespine sticklebacks.",Adaptation; Parental care; brain size; fish; stickleback,"Department of Zoology and Biodiversity Research Centre, University of British Columbia Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.",en,Research Article,

Under these conditions, gene flow and recombination can impede adaptation by breaking down linkage disequilibrium between locally adapted alleles. Theory predicts that this decay can be halted or slowed if adaptive alleles are tightly linked in regions of low recombination, potentially favouring divergence and adaptive evolution in these regions over others. Here, we compiled a global genomic data set of over 1,300 individual threespine stickleback from 52 populations and compared the tendency for adaptive alleles to occur in regions of low recombination between populations that diverged with or without gene flow. In support of theory, we found that putatively adaptive alleles (FST and dXY outliers) tend to occur more often in regions of low recombination in populations where divergent selection and gene flow have jointly occurred. This result remained significant when we employed different genomic window sizes, controlled for the effects of mutation rate and gene density, controlled for overall genetic differentiation, varied the genetic map used to estimate recombination and used a continuous (rather than discrete) measure of geographic distance as proxy for gene flow/shared ancestry.

The leading hypothesis is that this similarity in divergence is driven by parallel natural selection. However, several recent studies have suggested that these patterns may instead be a product of the depletion of genetic variation that occurs as result of background selection (i.e., linked negative selection). To date, there have been few direct tests of these competing hypotheses. To determine the relative contributions of background selection and parallel selection to patterns of repeated differentiation, we examined 24 independently derived populations of freshwater stickleback occupying a variety of niches and estimated genomic patterns of differentiation in each relative to their common marine ancestor. Patterns of genetic differentiation were strongly correlated across pairs of freshwater populations adapting to the same ecological niche, supporting a role for parallel natural selection. In contrast to other recent work, our study comparing populations adapting to the same niche produced no evidence signifying that similar patterns of genomic differentiation are generated by background selection. We also found that overall patterns of genetic differentiation were considerably more similar for populations found in closer geographic proximity. In fact, the effect of geography on the repeatability of differentiation was greater than that of parallel selection. Our results suggest that shared selective landscapes and ancestral variation are the key drivers of repeated patterns of differentiation in systems that have recently colonized novel environments.",Gasterosteus aculeatus; adaptive evolution; genomics; natural selection; parallel evolution; threespine stickleback,,en,Research Article,

One aspect of this threat is the merging of species through increased hybridization3. The primary mechanism for this collapse is thought to be the weakening of ecologically mediated reproductive barriers, as demonstrated in cases of ‘reverse speciation’4,5. Here, we expand on this idea and show that adaptive introgression between species adapting to a shared, moving climatic optimum can readily weaken any reproductive barrier, including those that are completely independent of climate. Using genetically explicit forward-time simulations, we show that genetic linkage between alleles conferring adaptation to a changing climate and alleles conferring reproductive isolation (intrinsic and/or non-climatic extrinsic) can lead to adaptive introgression facilitating the homogenization of reproductive isolation alleles. This effect causes the decay of species boundaries across a broad and biologically realistic parameter space. We explore how the magnitude of this effect depends on the rate of climate change, the genetic architecture of adaptation, the initial degree of reproductive isolation, the degree to which reproductive isolation is intrinsic versus extrinsic and the mutation rate. These results highlight a previously unexplored effect of rapid climate change on species diversity.",,,,,

Here, we performed a comprehensive study of recombination rate (rate of meiotic crossing over) in two natural populations of Drosophila pseudoobscura from Utah and Arizona, USA. We used an amplicon sequencing approach to obtain high-quality genotypes in approximately 8,000 individual backcrossed offspring (17 mapping populations with roughly 530 individuals each), for which we then quantified crossovers. Interestingly, variation in recombination rate within and between populations largely manifested as differences in genome-wide recombination rate rather than remodeling of the local recombination landscape. Comparing populations, we discovered individuals from the Utah population displayed on average 8% higher crossover rates than the Arizona population, a statistically significant difference. Using a QST-FST analysis, we found that this difference in crossover rate was dramatically higher than expected under neutrality, indicating that this difference may have been driven by natural selection. Finally, using a combination of short- and long-read whole-genome sequencing, we found no significant association between crossover rate and structural variation at the 200-400 kb scale. Our results demonstrate that (1) there is abundant variation in genome-wide crossover rate in natural populations, (2) at the 200-400 kb scale, recombination rate appears to vary largely genome-wide, rather than in specific intervals, and (3) interpopulation differences in recombination rate may be the result of local adaptation.",Drosophila pseudoobscura; Q(ST)-F(ST); evolution; genetic map; meiosis; quantitative genetics; recombination rate; structural variation,"Department of Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC 27708, USA.

The syntR algorithm performs as well as previous ad hoc methods while being systematic, repeatable, and applicable to mapping chromosomal rearrangements in any group of species. In addition, we present a systematic survey of chromosomal rearrangements in the annual sunflowers, which is a group known for extreme karyotypic diversity. We build high-density genetic maps for two subspecies of the prairie sunflower, Helianthus petiolaris ssp. petiolaris and H. petiolaris ssp. fallax Using syntR, we identify blocks of synteny between these two subspecies and previously published high-density genetic maps. We reconstruct ancestral karyotypes for annual sunflowers using those synteny blocks and conservatively estimate that there have been 7.9 chromosomal rearrangements per million years, a high rate of chromosomal evolution. Although the rate of inversion is even higher than the rate of translocation in this group, we further find that every extant karyotype is distinguished by between one and three translocations involving only 8 of the 17 chromosomes. This nonrandom exchange suggests that specific chromosomes are prone to translocation and may thus contribute disproportionately to widespread hybrid sterility in sunflowers.

Understanding how this complex behavior arises requires identifying both the selective forces that may favor it, as well as characteristics of particular lineages that facilitate or hinder its evolution. One potential hindrance is the existence of discrimination against foreign offspring, an obstacle that would need to be overcome in order for alloparental care to evolve. In this study, we explored whether offspring discrimination may have constrained the evolution of alloparental care in social spiders in the genus Anelosimus. Social spiders are known for their cooperative behaviors, which include alloparental care. After quantitatively assessing the extent of alloparenting in the care of egg sacs in natural nests of these spiders, we investigated whether discrimination against foreign egg sacs existed in ancestral pre-social species in the genus. We did so by testing for discrimination between a female’s own and foreign egg sacs in three subsocial sister taxa of each social species investigated. We found no detectable evidence of discrimination in the care of egg sacs by female Anelosimus, regardless of level of sociality. We used these data, along with those from previous studies, to infer that a lack of discrimination is likely the ancestral state in the genus Anelosimus. This supports the idea that offspring discrimination was not a constraint on the evolution of alloparental care in social Anelosimus species. We discuss the evolutionary implications of this finding, and suggest that lack of offspring discrimination may have eased the transition from solitary to cooperative breeding.",,,,,

Among the most fundamental of these summary statistics are π and dXY , which are used to describe genetic diversity within and between populations, respectively. Here, we address a widespread issue in π and dXY calculation: systematic bias generated by missing data of various types. Many popular methods for calculating π and dXY operate on data encoded in the variant call format (VCF), which condenses genetic data by omitting invariant sites. When calculating π and dXY using a VCF, it is often implicitly assumed that missing genotypes (including those at sites not represented in the VCF) are homozygous for the reference allele. Here, we show how this assumption can result in substantial downward bias in estimates of π and dXY that is directly proportional to the amount of missing data. We discuss the pervasive nature and importance of this problem in population genetics, and introduce a user-friendly UNIX command line utility, pixy, that solves this problem via an algorithm that generates unbiased estimates of π and dXY in the face of missing data. We compare pixy to existing methods using both simulated and empirical data, and show that pixy alone produces unbiased estimates of π and dXY regardless of the form or amount of missing data.

We generate high quality de novo genome assemblies and population genomic resources for multiple species of paper wasps and use a population genomic framework to interrogate the probable mode and tempo of cognitive evolution. Recent, strong, hard selective sweeps in P. fuscatus contain loci annotated with functions in long-term memory formation, mushroom body development, and visual processing, traits which have recently evolved in association with individual recognition. The homologous pathways are not under selection in closely related wasps that lack individual recognition. Indeed, the prevalence of candidate cognition loci within the strongest selective sweeps suggests that the evolution of cognitive abilities has been among the strongest selection pressures in P. fuscatus' recent evolutionary history. Detailed analyses of selective sweeps containing candidate cognition loci reveal multiple cases of hard selective sweeps within the last few thousand years on de novo mutations, mainly in noncoding regions.

However, the particular agents of selection that shape brain size variation remain obscure. Recent studies suggest that predators may select for larger brains because increased cognitive and sensory abilities allow prey to better elude predators. Yet, there is little direct evidence that exposure to predators causes the evolution of larger brains in prey species. We experimentally tested this prediction by exposing families of 1000-2000 F2 hybrid benthic-limnetic threespine stickleback to predators under naturalistic conditions, along with matched controls. After two generations of selection, we found that fish from the predator addition treatment had significantly smaller brains (specifically smaller telencephalons and optic lobes) than fish from the control treatment. After an additional generation of selection, we reared experimental fish in a common environment and found that this difference in brain size was maintained in the offspring of fish from the predator addition treatment. Our results provide direct experimental evidence that (a) predators can indeed drive the evolution of brain size--but not in the fashion commonly expected and (b) that the tools of experimental evolution can be used to the study the evolution of the vertebrate brain.",Brain; experimental evolution; predation; stickleback,"Department of Biology, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina 27708.

Behavioural and armour divergence between these species has been predicted to be the result of divergent selection driven in part by differential predation from cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki). To experimentally test this prediction, we reared split families of benthic–limnetic hybrids in the presence or absence of trout predation. Our results show that the presence of trout had little effect upon stickleback behaviour. We then compared performance in behavioural assays among stickleback that varied in armour to test if armour morphology correlates with behaviour. Our measurements revealed trait correlations between several behaviours and components of armour morphology. Trout predation did not result in an increased correlation between traits, therefore differential trout predation between benthics and limnetics is unlikely to be the cause of these correlations. The presence of trait correlations in advanced generation hybrids suggests that pleiotropy or linkage between genes underlying behaviour and armour morphology may be greater than previously appreciated.",,,en,Research Article,

Model-based population genetic methods that infer recombination rates from patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in the genome have become a popular method to estimate rates of recombination. However, these LD-based methods make a variety of simplifying assumptions about the populations of interest that are often not met in natural populations. One such assumption is the absence of gene flow from other populations. Here, we use forward-time population genetic simulations of isolation-with-migration scenarios to explore how gene flow affects the accuracy of LD-based estimators of recombination rate. We find that moderate levels of gene flow can result in either the overestimation or underestimation of recombination rates by up to 20-50% depending on the timing of divergence. We also find that these biases can affect the detection of interpopulation differences in recombination rate, causing both false positive and false negatives depending on the scenario. We discuss future possibilities for mitigating these biases and recommend that investigators exercise caution and confirm that their study populations meet assumptions before deploying these methods.",,,,Research Article,
